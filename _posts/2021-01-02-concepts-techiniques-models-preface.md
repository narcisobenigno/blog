Talks about different computation models. Been computation model a particular
way of how computation happens.

They constrast the notion of *computation model* with what he calls as vague
*programming pagadigm*. Not expanded so far, why *programming paradigm* is
vague.

Book intented to be practical, therefore they will define it using data types,
operations and a programming language.

A set of **Programming concepts** related to a given computation model define
a kernel language. Those programming concepts may be related to multiple
computation models.

The book adds a new concept to this kernel language every time when they face a
problem on the program which can be easily tackled by the existing concepts.

## Teaching programming

### [xv] Both science and technology

Rely on understand both aspects of programming. Science withouth techonology is
just math and technology without science is mostly do without understand
consequences, therefore limiting our capacity to get different problems in the
future.

### [xvi] More than craft

Understand more about programming rather than those paradigms. Do not separate
those computing model, understand them together and analyse them.

## [xvi] Kernel languages approach

I'm not quite sure yet what is this kernel languages. Is a language that we will
actually create?

Roughly, I understood is a simplified version using concepts from programming
models.

## [xvii] Designing abstrations

Abstractions is a tool or device which helps solve a particular problem. This
tool or device could be reused in multiple places. We got to learn how to design
those abstractions
