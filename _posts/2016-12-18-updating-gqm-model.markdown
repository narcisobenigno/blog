# My personal GQM

## Subject

The purpose is find out if apply raw algorithms can be useful for ThoughtWorks projects,
whatever if we are using data science or not in a project. Beyond that, I would like to
use this knowlendge to help the society. That last part I need to explore more possibilities,
but initially I want to take my career experience in ThoughtWorks and apply it to university
projects.

Another very important target is learn and share more about communication. Throughtout the
last year I read a lot about communication - I read books like Nonviolent communication and
crucial conversations - now it is time to share it and learn more and more.

## GQM

### Regarding algorithms

Goal      Purpose           | Learn and apply algorithms
          Issue             | Helping solve complex problems
          Object (learning) | using Algorithms 
          Viewpoint         | from ThoughtWorks and society viewpoint
                            |
Question                    | Is it possible to apply raw algorithms to solve better some
                            | problems in my current project?
                            |
Metric                      | Rise at least two opportunities to solve better a problem
                            | algorithms knowlendge until February 2017.
                            |
                            |
Question                    | How can apply the algorithms in my current project?
                            |
Metric                      | Apply algorithms knowlendge in the current project before
                            | leave to Brazil
                            |
                            |

                            |
Question                    | How much useful is have this knowlendge along with bigdata?
                            |
Metric                      | Understand deeply until the end of January 17th what is 
                            | bigdata and how I can apply algorithms in this area. The idea
                            | to mensure that is have a catchup with my sponsor (or
                            | someone else) showing the output of this research
