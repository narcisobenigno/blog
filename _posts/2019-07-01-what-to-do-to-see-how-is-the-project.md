# What to do to see how is the project

When I arrive at a new product development the following observations should be
done - i.e. how to properly setup my critical view about the current state of
the project?

Agile is not a thing itself, but it is what it is to help on the project. So,
thinking through the problems (like low development pace) and pourpose for that
(continuous integration, constant refactoring, continuous delivery,
prioritization, better code coverage and so on)

## What the product do?

## What are the plans for the product development?
