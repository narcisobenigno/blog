## Disclaimer

This is not meant to be a fully comprehensive text and I wont review it either.
Even then, I will try to keep it as understandable as possible for later recall.

## About the book

2017-02-06: First Release. Kindle version of Mike Amundsen

## Unsolved questions:

. There are few things that I could describe in terms of actions, but I would
have to always create a media type or at least a new one which supports those
kind of things.
  . One of those things that comes to my mind is: lets say one menu item has to
  subscribe for a push notification or even pulling some url for retrive some
  info;
