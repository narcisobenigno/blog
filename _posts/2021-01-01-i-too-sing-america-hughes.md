I, too, sing America.

I am the darker brother.\
They send me to eat in the kitchen\
When company comes,\
But I laugh,\
And eat well,\
And grow strong.

Tomorrow,\
I'll be at the table\
When company comes.\
Nobody'll dare\
Say to me\
"Eat in the kitchen",\
Then.\
Besides,\
They'll see how beautiful I am\
And be ashamed

I, too, am America.

HUGHES, Langston.
